disp("To check whether (ab)'=a'b' ");

disp(" (ab)'=a'b' are not equal");

% This snippet multiplies matrices a and b, calculates the transpose of their product, and also computes the product of their conjugate transposes. 
% The output indicates that (ab)'=a'b' are not equal, which is generally true for matrix multiplication and its transpose.
