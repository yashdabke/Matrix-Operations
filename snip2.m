disp("to check what a'' is equal to");
doubleconjugate = a''
disp("Hence proved a''=a ");

% This snippet calculates the double conjugate of the matrix a, which means taking the complex conjugate of a twice. 
% It then prints the result and states that a''=a, which is true because taking the complex conjugate twice cancels out and gives the original matrix.
