Matrix Determinants:
- Determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix.
- It represents various properties of the matrix, such as invertibility and volume scaling.
- Determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc.
- Determinant of an n x n matrix can be calculated using various methods, such as expansion by minors or using LU decomposition.

Diagonalisation of Matrices:
- Diagonalisation is a process to transform a matrix into a diagonal matrix.
- It's useful for simplifying matrix operations and solving certain equations.
- A matrix is diagonalizable if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is its dimension.
- Diagonalization involves finding a matrix P of eigenvectors and a diagonal matrix D such that P^(-1)AP = D, where A is the original matrix.

Printing Programs:
- Printing programs display information or output on a screen or paper (helps print a matrix in an organized format).
- They are essential for communication in programming and software development.
- In languages like Python, "print()" is a common function to output text or variables to the console.
- Printing can include formatted text, variables, calculations, and more.
- Properly formatted output enhances user experience and debugging.
