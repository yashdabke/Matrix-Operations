Diagonalisation:
- An n × n matrix A is diagonalizable if there exists matrix P such that D = P − 1AP, and D is a diagonal matrix.
- In addition, matrix A is diagonalizable if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors. 
- The n linear independent eigenvectors are the n columns of P.
- In this code we can determine if any square matrix A is diagonalizable and diagonalizes A if it is diagonalizable.
