% This snippet defines a matrix a with complex entries and then computes its complex conjugate and conjugate transpose. 
% The complex conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. 
% The complex conjugate of a matrix involves taking the complex conjugate of each element. 
% The conjugate transpose is the transpose of the complex conjugate of the matrix.
